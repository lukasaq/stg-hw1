destin florida
this weekend i went to the Destin Florida beach about an hour away from Pensacola. this was a new experience for me going over there and exploring that area which i find is much more pleasnt then pesacola, i spent most my time on the beach and trying out new resturants / food place, of the ones i went to my favorite was "Dat Burrito Place" its a mexican food spot in destin that specializes in burritos but also offer a large variety of mexican food from tacos to chips and queso and a bunhc more variety of food i highly recommend it ot anyone going to destin. all in all destin florida was a 10 / 10 experience and do plan to go back there sometime soon, but out of everything i think my favorite party about going to destin was the drive as it is very beautiful relaxing and just nice in general.
